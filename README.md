# Fujitsu Autonomous Driving
####Autonomous driving algorithm for a toy car, using scenarios with no white lane markings.

####This project is part of the Cal State LA senior design class and is sponsored in part by Fujitsu

##Project Description:
One of the critical challenges that needs to be addressed is how to enable self-driving on roads without clear lane marks. Nowadays, with the great efforts from high-tech companies such as Tesla, Mercedes, autonomous vehicles are able to drive safely on highways, change lanes and park without human help. However, it has been widely observed that current autonomous vehicles are struggling on roads without clear lane marks. They are easily flummoxed by faded lane markers, damaged or noncompliant signs or lights, and the many quirks of a roadway infrastructure managed by thousands of state and local bureaucracies. There is a great need to address this practical problem. In this project, we plan to use machine learning, computer vision and other artificial intelligence techniques to develop a smart robot vehicle that can drive safely on roads without clear lane marks. We plan to build a prototype to validate our system and algorithm design.
